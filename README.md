# Vernam cipher on MIPS64 architecture

## Project from [INP](https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/INP/.en) university course 2022/23

The goal of the project was to write a program  in the [MIPS64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture) symbolic instruction language implementing a modified [Vernam ciplher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Vernam#The_Vernam_cipher) algorithm.

## Implementation details
The development and testing process was performed using the [EduMIPS64](https://edumips.org/) simulator. The program code is in the file `xvinog00.s`
